This began as a largely indepedent challenge, but I turned to my Tutor for help. She did a fantastic job at clearing out the noise. I had a lot of the logic correct, but the way I was doing it was so much more than it needed to be.

A win for me this challenge was getting the MYSQL syntax down. Creating a database, schema, and seeds is easy for me. What I see as an opportunity is getting confident with INQUIRER. The flow of a PROMPT and how to call certain function is definitely something I could do better.

This challenge was tasked with the following bonus tasks that I did not complete:
>Application allows users to update employee managers.  
>Application allows users to view employees by manager.  
>Application allows users to view employees by department.  
>Application allows users to delete departments, roles, and employees.  
>Application allows users to view the total utilized budget of a departmentâ€”in other words, the combined salaries of all employees in that department.

If I could get all of this to work, that would be awesome.
